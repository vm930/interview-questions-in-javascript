// Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
// Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

//Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
// Output: [4, 1, 9]
// Input: head = [4, 5, 1, 9], node = 1
// Output: [4, 5, 9]

function deleteNote(node) {}
